**Welcome To Ben Kasson's 360 Video Project**

This site hosts files from my 3D 360 videos shot during a Mercer JMS Media Entrepreneurship 2017 course.

In summary, these videos had a cummulative reach of **6.1** K views on the CCJ FB page and my youtube channel. 
Views alone do not capture the full depth of knowledge that I gained from this course. I had to learn how to create edit and publish in a media that was completely foreign to me at the outset of the project. After the initial purchase of the camera, and with access to adobe products via the ccj, I was able to capture these media pieces with no financial investment. The idea I had going into the project was to capture live public events, market them as "remote-experiences", and then see how much traction the content could accumulate. For more information on the readings and resources I utilized throughout this project visit the **About** page.
